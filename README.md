This project explores the sales performance of Rabaks Superstore over the first quarter of 2019 using a real-world transactional dataset. The analysis dives into customer behavior, product preferences, and purchasing patternshighlighting insights like peak shopping hours, top-selling product lines, and the most effective sales branches. I created an interactive dashboard to visualize trends in revenue, customer types, and payment methods, with the goal of helping decision-makers make smarter inventory, marketing, and staffing choices.
